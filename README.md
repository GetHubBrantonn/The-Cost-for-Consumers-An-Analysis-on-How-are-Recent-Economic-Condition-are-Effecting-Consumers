# The Cost for Consumers: An Analysis on How are Recent Economic Condition are Effecting Consumers

This project investigates how current economic conditions are impacting consumers, particularly through changes in the stock market and consumer prices. With widespread debate over whether we are in a recession, this analysis doesn't aim to answer that directly—but instead, it explores key indicators that affect everyday financial experiences.

The project focuses on two main questions:
1. **How has the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) changed over the past year and beyond?**
2. **What trends are we seeing in the stock market, and what might they indicate about broader economic conditions?**
